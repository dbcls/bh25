# DBCLS BioHackathon 2025

## Objectives

### Accelerate data science through the integrated use of databases in life sciences.

The BioHackathon in Japan, hosted by the Database Center for Life Science (DBCLS), prioritizes research topics that focus on the integrated use of databases in life sciences. Our focus is continuously on the standardization and interoperability of life sciences and biomedical databases (knowledge graphs). Simultaneously, by combining innovative approaches with information from literature, we aim to enable new discoveries through the development of methods and applications in data science.
